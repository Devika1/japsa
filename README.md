### Welcome to Japsa

Japsa is a Java Package for Sequence Analysis. As the name implies, Japsa was 
written primarily in Java. It contains a large number of ready to run programs 
as well as a Java API. Please note that from our newest versions, it is required 
Java 8 to compile and run from the source code. Prebuilt releases would need 
JVM 1.8.0_144 or newer to run properly.

### Installation and Usage

Quick installation guide:
```
git clone https://github.com/mdcao/japsa
cd japsa
make install \
  [INSTALL_DIR=~/.usr/local \] 
  [MXMEM=7000m \] 
  [SERVER=true \] 
  [JLP=/usr/lib/jni:/usr/lib/R/site-library/rJava/jri]
```
